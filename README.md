# Image-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks :mag:

Image recognition involves assigning a label to an entire image or photograph.

Some examples of image recognition include:

- Labeling an x-ray as cancer or not (binary classification).
- Classifying a handwritten digit (multiclass classification).
- Assigning a name to a photograph of a face (multiclass classification).

In this project, I have developed an image classifier model to identify the type of images and also tried to understand the working of the pre-trained VGG-16 library. 

### Models Explored
